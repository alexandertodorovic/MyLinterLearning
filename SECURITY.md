# Security Policy
The source code in this project is only for playful learning of linters in Python and not for integration in software projects. Security relevant lines of code in the templates are in most cases intentional, e.g. to detect them with flake8-bandit.

Even if security issues are unlikely in the project itself, they can of course always occur.

## Supported Versions

Any version supported.
